# The backstory 

* In this fictional time-line, alien sightings and contact have been
relatively commonplace since a partial invasion of the U.S. in 1981
* The U.S. has a different configuration of States and Republics, with
no federal government

# Our customer

* Able Probe, Inc. (ableprobe.com) provides UFO incident recording
services to state governments 
* Citizens send messages to Able Probe
staff working on behalf of the state, & staff record, analyze and
report on UFO incidents 
* Company culture is inconsistent and evolving
from ex-military to Web-centric 
* Majority of staff are data-entry
people

# The product
* Able Probe has recently won a contract renewal with the Pacifica
Stateâ€™s Department of Extra-Terrestrial Tracking & Response (DETTR)
* Contract stipulates a Web-centric update to the aging software used
by the staff: the State UFO Reporting System (SUFORS).
* Able Probe is partnering with Alt.NET to develop the new application
since they do not have experienced developers in-house

# The people
* Citizens: Send messages to DETTR via email, text messaging and voice mail
* Incident Recorders: Work for Able Probe on behalf of DETTR, use SUFORS to convert Citizen messages into Incident Records
